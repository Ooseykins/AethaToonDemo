# AethaToon

## A toon shader for Vtubers, made for Unity's built-in renderer for use in Warudo

---

To install: download the latest .unitypackage from releases, or purchase the full version at https://oose.itch.io/aethatoon

---

Artists: you are free to distribute the DEMO version of Aethatoon with your source files when requested by a client. Do NOT distribute the full version of AethaToon, except when packaged as a final product, such as a .warudo character file. If you could please ask your client to purchase AethaToon at https://oose.itch.io/aethatoon or use the "Downgrade to demo version" button on the material inspector.

AethaToon Snapshot is an included tool, you can freely exclude it when importing the .unityproject file. It's available from the top toolbar. It's for taking screenshots of the game view while editing your materials. I made it for myself to help create before and after images, but I thought it was helpful enough to make available as part of the project.

If you use this project I'd love to see what you've made!
